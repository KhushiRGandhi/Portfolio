                <h3>Intelligent Illumination</h3>
                <p>This motion-activated illumination system employs an LDR to enable operation solely in low-light environments. It maintains a standby brightness of 30% until a sensor detects movement, triggering a rapid increase to 100% intensity. Power is supplied by detachable batteries rechargeable via integrated solar panels.</p>
				<p>This project has been well recognized by various authorities. Has also been presented in various hackathons where it gained the approval. This project also won the first prize at ISTE Shark Tank. </p>
